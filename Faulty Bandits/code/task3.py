This file contains the FaultyBanditsAlgo class. Here are the method details:
    - __init__(self, num_arms, horizon, fault): This method is called when the class
        is instantiated. Here, you can add any other member variables that you
        need in your algorithm.
    
    - give_pull(self): This method is called when the algorithm needs to
        select an arm to pull. The method should return the index of the arm
        that it wants to pull (0-indexed).
    
    - get_reward(self, arm_index, reward): This method is called just after the 
        give_pull method. The method should update the algorithm's internal
        state based on the arm that was pulled and the reward that was received.
        (The value of arm_index is the same as the one returned by give_pull.)
